Ask facebook to unransom your data.

# Facebook holds your data for ransom.

Me and presumably many others are victim of a toxic abuse relationship called "facebook membership". Ending it proves to be near impossible. I have long been trying to download my very own data through the intentioned APIs/Facebook settings. Due to [Dark Patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) it proves neigh impossible to succeed in doing so. This site is to coordinate a social media campaign to unransom our very own Facebook Data (as allowed by the GDPR). Feel free to share with the hashtag: #FBUnransom.

# More stories to come.
